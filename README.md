HTML Foundations Recipe Project:

To Whom It May Concern,

    You have stumbled upon my very first coding project. With this project I intend to accomplish a handful of things.
        1) I wish to demonstrate a level of competency with basic HTML. In doing so I wish to build the framework for a basic, functional, site.
        2) Show an ability to write clean, human-readable code, free of syntax issues, and adhering to the HTML-5 guidelines.
        3)Demonstrate an understanding of basic HTML elements, as outlined in the HTML Foundations course provided by The Odin Project.
        4)Upon completion of the CSS Foundations, I will return to this project to make it less ugly.
